Briefly describe what this code sample does:
--------------------------------------------
This is a Personalized Study Assistant that uses AI to help students interact with their study materials through natural language. Students can upload documents (PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoints) which are processed using LangChain and stored in a vector database, then ask questions about the content and receive AI-powered answers using Google's Gemini API with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The application features a Streamlit web interface, persistent chat sessions, document summarization, and is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

Briefly describe what you learned when you created this code sample:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I learned how to implement a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system by integrating multiple AI technologies including vector embeddings, semantic search, and large language models to create contextually-aware responses. I gained experience with production-ready Python development practices including modular architecture, environment configuration management, error handling, and containerization with Docker. Additionally, I learned how to build responsive web applications using Streamlit while managing complex application state and implementing features like file upload processing, chat interfaces, and real-time document analysis.

Why do you want to become an MLH Fellow?
----------------------------------------
Curiosity is the kind of fuel that got me as a software engineer, curiosity that refuses to rest at "can this be done" but instead asks, "who does this help, and how far can it scale?" As a Brown Indian immigrant who arrived to grow up in Saint Louis as a second language learner, my path into tech wasn't normal. I started college as a pre-law major, driven by a desire for social justice—I wanted to fight systemic injustices in the law, to give voice to communities like mine that too frequently had none. But then when I worked immigration paperwork for my family members, witnessed the digital divide among my neighbors, and saw how technology could reinforce or tear down borders, I realized that code possessed the same power as legal briefs to change the world. The transition wasn't easy—I jumped through hoops that many peers never did, constantly having to prove my English fluency, doing twice the work to be viewed as equally qualified, and constantly code-switching from the home identity to the identity needed to succeed in mostly white tech spaces.

My pre-law background gave me a passion for advocacy and systemic change that I now use through technology. Rather than seeing combat with inequality within courtrooms, I now see the potential to fight it using accessible technologies, inclusive design, and products for marginalized populations. Over the last couple of years, I've been fortunate to have had my work in environments where that question mattered: I've architected RAG-based customer service systems, architected services in AWS infrastructures with millions of endpoints, and written code that has saved teams tens of thousands of dollars in operating costs. But the hours that I still remember best are the late-night whiteboard productions and frenetic group debugging long-distance running events where one learned most rapidly, with people who caused one to think otherwise.

The MLH Fellowship is the perfect combination of these passions—a chance to contribute to open source projects creating actual impact and be part of a community that both upholds technical merit and social good. Having switched from prelaw to software engineering, I understand and value guided experiences that can help launch careers. MLH's dedication to improving underprivileged individuals chances into breaking into technology is a reflection of my own battle for acceptance in society.  I'd love to apply my technical expertise and trained legal systematic thinking to projects that democratize resource access, bridge digital divides, and yield more equitable outcomes in a culture that values collaboration, accountability, and open criticism. 

The MLH Fellowship is a diverse community that welcomes Fellows from a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. What perspective or experience will you bring to the fellowship to strengthen our community?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
My upbringing as a cultural bridge taught me how to be a strong voice for justice, navigating American systems while retaining my Indian heritage. I believe my history with immigration and passion for society helps me create and thrive in inclusive work environments where people from diverse backgrounds are valued and appreciate. I approach technical problems with an equity-first mindset, asking more than just "does this work?" but also "who might this leave behind?" This method pushes me to consider inclusive design, accessibility, and the wider societal effects of the products I develop.

Most importantly, I bring genuine vulnerability and a growth mindset that I grew through my unconventional path into technology. I'm comfortable being the person who asks "obvious" questions because I've learned that admitting what I don't know isn't a sign of weakness; it's the quickest way to grow. I believe that iteration is more important than perfection, curiosity is more valuable than appearing clever, and that this provides psychological safety for others to take risks and learn openly. Beyond just writing code, I want to contribute to the creation of a community in which different points of view are genuinely valued and we constantly question who our work serves and who it may exclude.
